# Shopping Cart Project

This project was created to demonstrate proficiency in React by building a mock shopping cart application. The primary objective was to apply concepts such as routing, state management, and component structuring while creating a functional and visually appealing shopping cart interface. The application emphasizes user interaction and smooth navigation.
